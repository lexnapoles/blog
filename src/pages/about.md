Welcome! I'm Alejandro, a Spanish software developer based in London with 7+ years of experience.

I consider myself a curious, eclectic person. If one thing could be said about me is that I'm passionate about learning. My interests are all over the place: product management, software architecture, system thinking, agile, DevOps, leadership, culture, entrepreneurshipâ€¦

Besides professional interests, I love music, video games, reading books and comics and training for strength and health, there has to be a balance between mind and body.

I believe that creating products and developing software is as much of a technical endeavour as it is intrinsically social and human. At the same time, I had the immense luck of working with many teams and experienced different ways of working and domains. Some teams had modern practices (Extreme Programming, DevOps) that impacted my understanding of what software development could be.
